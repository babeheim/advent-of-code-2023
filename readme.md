In part 1, we count up the number of winning numbers on each card to find the score. In part 2, the number of winning numbers causes subsequent cards to duplicate in a cascade.

If a number is adjacent to a "symbol" (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `@`, `&`, `#`, `%`, `$`), we want to sum it up in part 1. If not adjacent to a symbol, we ignore it!

In part 2, we multiply each pair of numbers that are adjacent to a gear symbol ("*"), and add those up.

We are playing a game with a bag containing an unknown number of reg, green, and blue cubes. We get to see random draws from the bag over and over, and have to decide if the game's bag is consistent with a specific number of drawn cubes of each color, e.g. the bag contains at least 20 red cubes if we saw a sample with that many cubes.

The task is to identify digits inside an alphanumeric text string and do operations on them. In Part II, some of the digts are spelled out as letters, and there's a trick because some letters are shared between two numbers, e.g. `oneight` is both 1 and 8.
